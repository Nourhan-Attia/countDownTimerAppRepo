#count down timer project
## general goal of the project : timer that shows how many days , hours, mins, and seconds far we are from a new year(more advanced example would be to show how far we far we are from a user input year)

## personal goal of the project : practice js, so don't focus much on styling

## functional requirements 
- no user interactivity (initially)
- maybe use the date object 

## challenges i faced
- how to center div vertically in css
- need to review date object

## how did i fix problems i faced
- for center div vertically : use position relative on the parent , absolute on the child (the div u wanna center), also on the child top:50%, left:50%, transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
