#count down timer mini project
## general goal of the project : timer that shows how many days , hours, mins, and seconds far we are from a new year(more advanced example would be to show how far we far we are from a user input year)

## personal goal of the project : practice js, so don't focus much on styling

## functional requirements 
- no user interactivity (initially)
- maybe use the date object 
- allow user to enter a specific date(not advanced, pretty simple actually)

## concepts i think i will use in the solution
- the date object
- DOM manipulation
- math 
- loop(i didn't really need one , even though i could find number of months via one , it wasn't the simplest way to calculate the rest of dates)

## challenges i faced
- how to center div vertically in css
- need to review date object
- didn't know the math required for that 
- still new with github and terminal
- used getElementsByClassName which gave back a collection when i just needed the first item so i had to use getQuerySelector instead

## how did i fix problems i faced
- for center div vertically : use position relative on the parent , absolute on the child (the div u wanna center), also on the child top:50%, left:50%, transform: translate(-50%,-50%)
- reviewd date object
- googled for math required for the answer
